This GitHub repository contains the code used to train and run inference with the 31-km and 6-km AI-driven weather models described in the manuscript **Configuration and evaluation of km-scale AI-driven weather models for precipitation forecasting**.
The repository includes an `environment.yml` file that specifies the exact library versions used in the experiments.
To create the Conda environment, run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
